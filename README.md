## rust-vm

Barebones implementation of a virtual machine. It only supports basic instructions:

- Push
- Pop
- Plus
- Minus
- Mul
- Div
- Halt

The "parser" for programming in whatever this thing is is extremely simple and picky, take that into account.

This is not a serious project or anything of the like, it's just for learning purposes.
